t the praise did you just praising say about me, you little hollow? 
I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Darkwraiths, 
and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on The Kiln of the First Flame, 
and I have over 300 confirmed PVP kills.
I am trained in DEX warfare and I’m the top sinner in the entire Book of the Guilty.
You are nothing to me but just another Humanity.
I will lagstab you with precision the likes of which Lordran has never seen before, mark my words.
You think you can get away with Dark Bead spamming? Think again, Moonbro.
As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Darkwraiths across Lordran and your Soul Sign is being traced right now so you better prepare for the Firestorm, Beanpole.
The Pyromancy that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re praising dead. 
I can be anywhere, anytime with my Red Eye Orb, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my Uchigatana.
Not only am I extensively trained in buff combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Blacksmith Andre and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable soul off the face of the continent, you little catbro.
If only you could have known what occult retribution your little “clever” magic spam was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have black crystaled out.
But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you "MLG Pro". I will Great Combustion all over you and you will drown in it. You’re praising dead, hollow.
